    "# What is SASS and why is SASS useful for us? \n",
    "- SASS stands for syntactically awesome stylesheets. \n",
    "- SASS is extremely helpful because it lessens the overall complexity of customization that we get with coding directly with CSS\n",
    "- SASS creates a compiler that allows us to write stylesheets with <code>.sass</code> and <code>.scss</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the differences between all these \n",
    "- SCSS includes all CSS features + more\n",
    "- CSS is a style language that is used to style and create web pages. While SCSS is a particular type of file for SASS, it used the Ruby language, which assembles the browser's CSS style sheets.\n",
    "- SCSS contains advanced and modified features.\n",
    "- SCSS is more syntax-oriented than CSS. SCSS uses fewer lines in its code than CSS, which makes programming easier\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are coding benefits:\n",
    "    - SASS has variables that we can use \n",
    "    - In many cases, classes are used as name spaces, which means they are duplicated over and over again. We can avoid this by nesting styles inside the parent\n",
    "    - They already have some built in functions for us to use\n",
    "    - Once your done with the UI, the compiler will take your code and convert it to valid CSS that works\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are coding drawbacks:\n",
    "    - The browser can't read SASS, only CSS. As a result, you must have the \"Live Sass Complier\" extension installed. This extension will convert SASS to CSS. \n",

This can be especially useful for maintaining consistency across a website or application."

    "In this example, we have a container element with a maximum width of 960 pixels and centered margin. Within the container, we have a content section with a background color and padding. Using a media query with @media (min-width: 768px) we apply some changes when the viewport width is 768 pixels or wider. In this case, we use the display property to switch to a flex layout, with the content and sidebar elements arranged side by side. We then use specific styles for the .sidebar and .content elements to adjust their width and margins. Using media queries like this can help you create responsive layouts that adjust to different devices and screen sizes, improving the user experience on different devices."

You can configure the Sass compiler to output the compiled CSS files to a specific directory, such as _sass or assets/css, so that they can be easily included in your Fastpages site.\n",
